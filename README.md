# Java Multithreading & Concurrency Examples

ðŸ’«  **multithreading and concurrency concepts**, essential for building scalable APIs, microservices, and cloud applications.

## Overview

Multithreading allows running multiple tasks simultaneously to make systems faster, responsive, and scalable. This repository includes practical examples that cover key Java concurrency concepts.

### Key Concepts Implemented

- **Thread Lifecycle:** Demonstrates `New â†’ Runnable â†’ Running â†’ Waiting/Blocked â†’ Terminated`.
- **Runnable vs Callable:** 
  - `Runnable` for tasks without return values.
  - `Callable` for tasks that return results.
- **Executor Service:** Efficiently manages thread pools and reduces overhead.
- **Race Conditions:** Examples of race conditions and solutions using `synchronized`, `Locks`, and `volatile` variables.
- **Concurrent Collections:** Using `ConcurrentHashMap` and `BlockingQueue` for safe multi-threaded operations.
- **Future & CompletableFuture:** Asynchronous programming without blocking the main thread.

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Web Applications & APIs:** Handling multiple user requests concurrently.
- **Microservices:** Running independent tasks in parallel, such as fetching data from multiple services.
